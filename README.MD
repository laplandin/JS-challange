# JavaScript base

It was my personal challenge for structuring information from several books in one place with code examples for copy and usage it by demand. Also I plan to test all of code with Jest and write some documentation for each class or snippet.

You can find appropriate section folders and files by names, listed below.

This is repository contains some useful information of JavaScript parties such as:

### Design Patterns
- Singleton
- Factory

### Algorithms

### Data Structures
- List 
- Stack
